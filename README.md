# IdrisiRaster-R
This repository contains a Windows executable, a series of Idrisi Raster image files, and an R script to automate the estimation of statistically significant temporal trends, average, and coefficient of variation on each pixel. The R code connects to the C language via command shell in order to pre-process the input raster imagery for R.
